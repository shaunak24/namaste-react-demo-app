Everything is a component in React!

Types of components -
1. Functional components (New way)
2. Class Based components

- For any component, name starts with uppercase
- Component Composition - using 1 one component inside other, haha!

- JSX can only have one parent
- So instead of using <div> for having 3 parents, react gives us access to "React.Fragment"
- Fragment is a component, like a empty tag
- Instead of <React.Fragment> we can also write <>
